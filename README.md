# Effect Parametricity Using Agda

This repository contains proofs of some results involving monads in general and effect parametricity in particular.
The effect parametricity results are based on the paper "Free Theorems Involving Type Constructor Classes" by Janis Voigtl√§nder (2009).

The proofs are written in the extension of Agda accompanying the paper "Parametric Quantifiers for Dependent Type Theory" by Andreas Nuyts, Andrea Vezzosi and Dominique Devriese (2017), available at the [parametric branch](https://github.com/agda/agda/tree/parametric) of the Agda repository.

The files TypeSystem.agda, Source.agda, Target.agda and Primitives.agda provide the type system we work in and are taken from the repository [parametric-demo](https://github.com/Saizan/parametric-demo), but TypeSystem.agda is extended and modified to contain for instance lists and natural numbers.

The mechanization of the example worked out in the TyDe extended abstract submission can be found in the module Simplified of the file [PurityPreservation.agda](EffectParametricity/PurityPreservation.agda).
